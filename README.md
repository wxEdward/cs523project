## Portable Voice Trigger Model

This is the repository for CS523 Final Project. All the codes are in project.ipynb. The notebook consists of four parts. 

### Data Processing and Loading
In the first two blocks, we load and split the dataset into training set and test set.

### Linear Model

In the third block, we implement models with 32 units. We train the model for 20 epochs and record the test result.

### 1D & 2D Conv model

In the rest blocks, we implement models using 1D and 2D conv layers. We train those models for 20 epochs and record the result.
